#### interests 🎹 🧠

interested in many things including music theory, music performance, music perception, neural networks, brain anatomy/function, language perception...basically anything that has to do with making sounds, hearing them and interpreting them...even if that means banging on pots and pans to experiment 🎶 🍳 🤣

also interested in the decentrelizing power of blockchain and its capacity to empower creatives...not the money hoarding aspect...
